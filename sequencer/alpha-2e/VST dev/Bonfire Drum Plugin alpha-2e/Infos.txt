MANUAL

Bonfire is a drum synthesizer with timbre controls for it's 3 different drum modules. Bonfire runs inside a DAW as a plugin and on phones and tablets as a drum machine via the MobMuPlat app.

Bonfire has 3 drum modules: Basic, Modern, Complex & Blend, where you can blend between each module.

MODULES

* Basic: Simple and chirpy synthesized drum machine sounds
* Modern: A deeper sound aimed at emulating an 80's-90's electric drum sound
* Complex: Realistic drum synthesizer using physical modeling, both kick and snare are made from different configurations of the module
