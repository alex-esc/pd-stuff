# Simple cross-platform drum sequencer

Runs on a computer, smartphone or tablet. Tested on Windows, iOS and Android.

You need to install Pure Data for this sequencer to run. Then open the file that ends with `.pd` with Pure Data and enjoy!

To run the patch on your phone or tablet you need to download an app called MobMuPlat. Then import both files (`.pd` and `.mmp`) into your device's MobMuPLat folder (once the app is installed you should have a folder called mobmuplat, use your device file browser to move the files into the mobmuplat folder). Now open the MobMuPlat app and browse the list of patches until you see the sequencer and tap on it to open it. (more detailed docuemntation soon to come)

Enjoy!
